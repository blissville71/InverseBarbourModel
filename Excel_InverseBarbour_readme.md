In the Excel version, values must be entered into all yellow cells and no other cells should be modified. Use the Solver AddIn (Data Menu) on Column V (blue) to optimize. The Solver should be specified to minimize the values of Column V based on modifying values in Column C. Resulting water sources are shown in red. All other values/calculations of parameters are currently hard coded, but could be modified based on user knowledge. Samples may be listed as annual increments (tree rings) or even seasonal increments (microslices of annual rings). Samples codes should carefully reflect site locations and plant species, as applicable. Climate variables should be reflective of the periods of growth for which the d18O values in cellulose are provided. See companion paper: Sargeant, C.I., C. Vallet-Coulomb, and M.B. Singer.
