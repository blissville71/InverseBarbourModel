This Matlab function is designed to take input from a text file (e.g., csv) and deliver output of back-calculated water source isotope ratios by the inverse Barbour method. It requires estimates of max and min values of relevant input parameters in the input file and thus produces error estimates based on Monte Carlo simulation. It also accounts for the machine error, which is passed to the function. See companion paper: Sargeant, C.I., C. Vallet-Coulomb, and M.B. Singer. In Review.
